<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was a project from the school. Before having the exam for JavaScript you had the possibility to make some exercise, so you can earn points which will be added to the points you will achive on the exam. For this you could do some exercises for the maximum points of two. As the Tic-Tac-Toe exercises gave directly the points of two, I decided to do this exercise.

For me the exercise wasn't simple at all, because during this time I didn't code a lot in JavaScript. So I first looked on the internet for a good tutorial about how to do is.
I looked up the code from the website [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-tic-tac-toe-game-using-javascript/) But I changed the code a lot, because the code wasn't so clean for me. So I cleaned it upðŸ˜‚. And since the project didn't satisfy me enough, I added a lot of nice stuff in it like points stand or when this person wins, then a altert comes and you can decide if you want to replay or stop.
